# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT distinct(tb1.num) as ConsecutiveNums
FROM logs as tb1, logs as tb2, logs as tb3
WHERE tb1.Id + 1= tb2.Id AND tb2.Id +1 = tb3.Id AND tb1.num=tb2.num AND tb3.num=tb2.num;

复制好三分 id依次+1, num相等

SELECT DISTINCT
  a.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
  Logs a
  JOIN Logs b ON b.id - a.id = 1 AND a.num = b.num
  JOIN Logs c ON c.id - b.id = 1 AND b.num = c.num;
  这是self join
