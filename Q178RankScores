# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT tb1.Score AS Score, (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT tb2.Score)
                         FROM Scores AS tb2
                         WHERE tb2.Score > tb1.Score) + 1 AS 'Rank'
FROM Scores AS tb1
ORDER BY tb1.Score DESC;

知识点： 首先desc升序 其次就是rank 复制一份1 count distince多少比它小的就可以了


FUNCTION() OVER(PARTITION BY x ORDER BY y ASC/DESC)
classifited by x, ordered by y
常用的 RANK    ROW_NUMBER    DENSE_RANK
      12245     12345        12234


SELECT score, 
       DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY score desc) AS `rank` 
FROM scores
ORDER BY `rank`
