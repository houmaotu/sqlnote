# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT tb1.id as id, tb1.visit_date as 'visit_date', tb1.people as people
FROM Stadium as tb1, Stadium as tb2, Stadium as tb3
WHERE tb1.people >= 100 AND tb2.people >= 100 AND tb3.people >= 100
      AND ( (tb1.id +1 = tb2.id AND tb1.id + 2 = tb3.id   OR
            ( tb1.id -1 = tb2.id AND tb1.id + 1 = tb3.id )  OR       
            ( tb1.id -1 = tb2.id AND tb1.id - 2 = tb3.id ))
        )
ORDER BY tb1.id;   

就是在where里面写出来各种的情况
