select a.s_id, c.s_name,a.s_score,b.s_score
from(
select s_id,c_id,s_score
from score
where
c_id = '01'
) as a
inner join
from(
select s_id,c_id,s_score
from score
where
c_id = '01'
) as b
on a.s_id = b.s_id
inner join student as c
on c_s_id = a.s_id
where a.s_score > b.score

题2 平均分>60的学号 平均成绩
select s_id,avg(s_score) as avgs
from score
group by s_id
having avgs>60

题3 所有学生的学号 姓名 选课数 总成绩
select a.s_id,count(b.c_id),sum(b.s_score)
from student as a
left join score as b 
on a.s_id = b.s_id
group by a.s_id

题4 查询姓侯的老师的个数
select ct(t_id)
from teacher 
where t_name like "hou%"

题5 查询没学过厚毛兔的课程

法1一段一段查询
select * from student
where s_id not in (
select s_id from score
where c_id = (
select c_id from courses 
where t_id = (select t_id from teacher
where t_name = 'Houmaotu'
)
)
)

法2 连起来
select * from students
where s_id not in(
select s_id from score as s
inner join course as c on s.c_id = c.c_id
inner join teacher as t on c_t_id = b.t_id
where t.t_name = 'houmaotu'
)

题6 学过厚毛兔的课的人
select st.*,s.*,t.* 
from student as st
inner join score as s on s.s_id = at.a_id
inner join course as c on s.c_id = c.c_id
inner join teacher as t on t,t_id = c.t_id
where t.t_name = 'houmaotu'
order by s.s_id

题7 学过1也学过2
select * from student
where s_id in
(
select a.s_id from
(select s_id from score where c_id = '01') as a
inner join (select s_id from score where c_id = '02') as b
on a.s_id = b.s_id
)

题8 课程2的总成绩
select sum(s_score) from score
where s_id = '02'

也可以group by having

题9 所有课程都<60

课程数 = 小于60 课程数
select *
from
(select s_id,count(c_id) as cnt from score
where s_score<60
group by s_id
) as a
inner join 
(select s_id,count(c_id) as cnt from score
group by s_id
) as b
on a.s_id = b.s_id
inner join student as t on s.s_id = t.s_id
where a=cnt = b.cnt

max<60
select * from
(select s_id from score
group by s_id
having max(s_score) < 60
)
inner join student

题10 没学全所有课
学生表格 和 没学全的了left join
select * 
from student as st
left join score as s on st.s_id = sc.s_id
group by st.s_id
having count(distince sc.c_id) < (select count(distinct c_id) from course)

学生id not in学全了
select *
from student as st
where s_id not in 
(
select s_id from score
group by s_id
having count(distince s_id) = (select count(distinct c_id) from course)
)
